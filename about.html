              <h2><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-fw"></i>The Problem</h2>
			  <p>Customers and employees want to speak up and offer feedback to companies but without tying that information to their social identity. Most companies ask for feedback now but use large surveys(takes time), offer prizes(extrinsic), and ask for personal information(intrusive+spam). They also ask for anonymous feedback but don't have a means to further communicate with the user after submission. The feedback is only visible to managers/owners meaning fellow colleagues miss out on the opportunity to support or improve the content.  Syner believes there are more powerful ways to handle such valuable information.</p>
			  <p><i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw fa-lq"></i> <b>A Solution -</b> Syner will pass that feedback to the company, while still allowing the user to be updated in the event that feedback has been modified or replied to. By acting as an intermediary we can protect the user's personal information from the company, while still supplying feedback that the company wouldn't have received. If the company makes an official statement or handles the feedback appropriately; this is an avenue for the company to increase transparency and trust with their customers/employees. The company also has the power to choose what feedback is shared publicly, within the employee network, or not at all.  This gives the organization more options to capture collaborative input from employees and colleagues.</p>
			  <p><b>With all these open standards, how will you pay the bills and grow your team/infrastructure?</b></p>
			  <p>Syner will provide a hosted anonymous feedback solution for organizations that charges a monthly subscription fee.  Similar to how Github allows for free open repositories, yet charges for private.  Once a minimum viable product state is reached we can go to crowd-funding sources like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Crowdfunder. Sharing our finance metrics is an important part of our dedication to transparency; community members can spot ways to further leverage our resources and curb expenses if we invite the world to participate in gauging the health of our system. We will also accept donations via USD and Bitcoin.</p>
			  <p><b>What is the ultimate purpose/goal here?</b></p>
			  <p>To build a community for anonymous problem reporting in combination with a paid to use product.</p>
			  <p><b>The Community</b> - A place for anyone to anonymously report problems they want to tie to geography and/or related subjects via tags. A place for people to connect/collaborate on topics they think are problems. A dashboard for anyone to see high activity problem topics.    </p>
			  <p>The long-term end goal is to visually represent high activity concerns on a map that are discernible to the average person. Before that can be considered, we need people to talk about what they perceive are problems and find a way for common concern to rate somewhat accurately in comparison to unimportant topics. How does Government Corruption versus American Idol weigh in comparison to the pool of topics? And in what geographic areas? These are questions we want to know and see. </p>
			  <p>Many people are afraid of sharing their concerns due to fear. They're afraid to tie personal or perceived problems to their social identity because it could impact their work/social life. They are worried about what their friends, family, co-workers, bosses might think. Removing that fear is the first step in talking about the problems we witness. Defining and collaboratively adding content, source material, and reported incidents to these problems is the next step before we can consider a more visual dashboard.</>

              <h2><i class="fa fa-list-ul fa-fw"></i>Core Concepts</h2>
				<ul class="fa-ul">
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-bolt fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>Speed & Ease Of Use</b> - Feedback users can submit content from visiting a single URL & choose whether to be updated on further changes or not. That's it.  We want to remove as many obstacles as possible for feedback submission; and build from that point.  No app download.  No user registration.  One text field. No advertisements. No spam/newsletter. No gimmicks. Simple & genuine.</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-eye fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>Transparency</b> - Trust is required for people to easily talk about their concerns. Share business practices, logged data (that doesn't share user personal information), expenses and revenue streams.  Show the true status/heath of the project.  Prove that we care about user's personal data.  Take a stance that we want to educate our community to improve their condition; that is our concern.  Great customer service begins with asking good questions, listening to feedback, and educating customers on how the product works.</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-smile-o fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>Community Culture</b> - We think positive community culture emerges when people who embody great qualities come together.  While it is easy to state a few such qualities: being honest, humble, open-minded, sceptical yet respectful, a willingness to help others.  Ultimately it comes down to those individuals who act on those characteristics to improve the overall quality of life for everyone involved.  This is a place for those who want to make the world a better place.  To create an environment where both like and unlike people can come together to share their perspective on what could be improved.  </li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-minus fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>Minimalism + Efficiency</b> - User experience must be obvious and reliable.  Don't get over-burdened with feature ideas and additions.  Focus on doing the bare minimum extremely well; if that is profitable and creates value then slowly step up.  Less is more.</li>					
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-edit fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>Collaborative Curation</b> - Shared editing & revision history is powerful, but it needs to be easier than wiki markup; a la <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>.  Allow users to add/reject each-others tag suggestions or URL attachments.</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code-fork fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>Open Source</b> - You can take the source code and run your own Syner site for your organization.  Ideas flow and grow, denying others the opportunity to take it where they want is not our objective.  Community goals & creating social value > excessive profit or attribution.</li>
