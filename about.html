              <h2><i class="fa fa-list-ul fa-fw"></i>Core Concepts</h2>
				<ul class="fa-ul">
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-bolt fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>Speed & Efficiency</b> - Users can submit content from visiting a single URL & choose whether to be updated on further changes or not. That's it.  Check out the first concept for submission: <a href="submit.html">Submission Page</a> (How would you make it easier?)</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-minus fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>Minimalism + Ease Of Use</b> - Don't ask for a survey, give them one text field.  If a user wants to be updated on the status of the content, they can leave an email address but we will not give that email out or attach it to the content.  Registered users can choose to submit with their account attached or not.</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-edit fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>Collaborative Curation</b> - Shared editing & revision history is important, but it needs to be easier than wiki markup; a la <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>.  Allow users to add/reject each-others tag suggestions or URL attachments.</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-eye fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>Transparency</b> - Share business practices, logged data (that doesn't share personal information), expenses and revenue streams.  Show the true status of the project.  We should  </li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code-fork fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>Open Source</b> - You can take the source code and run your own Syner site for your organization.  Let them make it extensive, or customize it to their industrial needs.  We want to be the backbone of development but can still prosper from their innovations.  Our specific value proposition is easy to setup and manage hosted solutions, not controlling the source. </li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-gamepad fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>80/20 Rule of Thumb</b> - Few people produce large amounts of quality work in comparison to the mass amount of minimal content submissions.  We must recognize and support the core community that does this important work.  We should install game mechanics that drive reputation and unlock functionality for those who go beyond first submission reporting & browsing content.</li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-ban fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>No Ads</b> - The user experience should not be influenced, or intruded upon by advertisements.  If a commercial product or service is related to content in question then it is subject to relevance scrutiny of the user-base like anything else.  </li>
					<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-smile-o fa-fw fa-lg"></i><b>Community Culture</b> - We think good community culture emerges when people who embody great qualities come together.  While it is easy to state a few such qualities: being honest, humble, open-minded, sceptical yet respectful, a willingness to help others.  Ultimately it comes down to those individuals who act on those characteristics to improve the overall quality of life for everyone involved.  This is a place for those who want to make the world a better place.  To create an environment where both like and unlike people can come together to share their perspective on what could be improved.  </li>

              <h2><i class="fa fa-question-circle fa-fw"></i>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			  <p><b>What is the goal here?</b></p>
			  <p>To build a community and a product.</p>
			  <p><b>The Community</b> - A place for anyone to anonymously report problems they want to tie to geography and/or related subjects via tags. A place for people to connect/collaborate on topics they think are problems. A dashboard for anyone to see high activity problem topics.    </p>
			  <p>The long-term end goal is to visually represent high activity concerns on a map that are discernable to the average person. Before that can be considered, we need people to talk about their problems and find a way for common concern to rate somewhat accurately in comparison to unimportant topics. How does Government Corruption versus American Idol weigh in comparison to the pool of topics?  And in what geographic areas? These are questions we want to know and see. But first, we need people to talk about their problems (or what they think are problems). Many people are afraid of sharing their concerns due to fear. Fear of what their others think. They're afraid to tie personal or perceived problems to their social identity online because it could impact their work/social life. They are worried about what their friends, family, co-workers, bosses might think. Removing that fear is the first step in talking about the problems we witness. Defining and collaboratively adding content, source material, and reported incidents to these problems is the next step before we can consider a more visual dashboard.  </p>
			  <p><b>The Product</b> - A means to financially support the community and invite organizations into the benefit of interpreting anonymous feedback.</p> 			  
			  <p><b>With all these open standards, how will you pay the bills and grow your team/infrastructure?</b></p>
			  <p>Syner will provide a hosted anonymous feedback solution for organizations that charges a monthly subscription fee.  Similar to how Github allows for free open repositories, yet charges for private.  Once a minimum viable product state is reached we can go to crowd-funding sources like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Crowdfunder. Sharing our finance metrics is an important part of our dedication to transparency; community members can spot ways to further leverage our resources and curb expenses if we invite the world to participate in gauging the health of our system. We will also accept donations via USD and Bitcoin.</p>
			  <p></p>
			  <p><b>How will the paid hosted anonymous feedback solution work?</b></p>
			  <p><b>The Problem:</b> Customers and employees want to speak up and offer feedback to companies but without tying that information to their social identity. Most companies ask for feedback now but use large surveys(takes time), offer prizes(extrinsic), and ask for personal information(intrusive+spam). They also ask for anonymous feedback but don't have a means to further communicate with the user after submission. The feedback is only visible to managers/owners meaning fellow colleagues miss out on the opportunity to support or improve the content.  Syner believes there are more powerful ways to handle such valuable information.</p>
			  
			  <p><b>A Proposed Solution:</b> Syner will pass that feedback to the company, while still allowing the user to be updated in the event that feedback has been modified or replied to. By acting as an intermediary we can protect the user's personal information from the company, while still supplying feedback that the company wouldn't have received. If the company makes an official statement or handles the feedback appropriately; this is an avenue for the company to increase transparency and trust with their customers/employees. The company also has the power to choose what feedback is shared publicly, within the employee network, or not at all.  This gives the organization more options to capture collaborative input from employees and colleagues.</p>
			  <p><b>Is this a Q&A Site?</b></p>
			  <p>No; there are already great existing platforms for Q&A. <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> and <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a> for example.  If anything their content should be linked to from Syner.  Syner connects people and content that already exists on the web in the process of defining problem topics or tags.
