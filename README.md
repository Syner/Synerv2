=======

A tool for collecting anonymous feedback.  

Syner is a simple project to create a free to use web application for anonymous collaborative problem solving.  Syner wants to make it ultra easy for people to vent/complain/brainstorm in relation to the emotion felt when frustrated with a topic/subject.  

In problem solving: acknowledgement is the first step.  Syner attempts to tackle the topic of problem acknowledge by allowing people to anonymously report and communicate with eachother by generating simple posting boards that can be collaboratively edited by anyone who has URL access to that board without registering an account.
